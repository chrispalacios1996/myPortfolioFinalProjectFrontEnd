  <h4 style="text-align: center"> What is Tennis? </h4>
<p style="text-align: center"> Tennis is a non-contact sport that was created in 1859. Originally thought to be from Birmingham, <br>England, Tennis is now a sport played worldwide by all levels and ages. Many believe that the <br>game was originally invented in the 12th century in France; where a ball was struck with the<br>palm of the hand, similar to handball. It can be played individually against another<br> opponent, or between two teams of two players.
</p>
  <h4 style="text-align: center"> Game Objective:
    </h4>
<p style="text-align: center">
The objective of Tennis is very simple; a player must hit the ball in a way that his/her <br>opponent will not be able to return it. The player who is unable to return the ball<br> will not gain a point, while the other player will. In other sports such as hockey and <br>soccer, points increase by 1 every time a player scores; however, in Tennis that is not the <br>case. Every time a player wins a rally (tennis play), points will increase from <br>15 to 30, and 30 to 40. While the game of Tennis may look easy, it is definitely not.

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center">When playing tennis, always be sure to carry a water bottle as this sport <br>is very exhausting. You will be running up and down and side to side<br> most of the time and will only receive a few 20 second breaks; these breaks<br> will be taken while standing.
